# visualizing-gender-gaps-by-college-degrees

Requirements:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

This project is mainly a data visualization project. We attempt to use data visualization techniques 
such as line charts and optimize our charts by increasing data-ink ratio. 

In this project, we also 
explore which college degrees have the widest gender gaps and see which ones have majority female or
majority male.
